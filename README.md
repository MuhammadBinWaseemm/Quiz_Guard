# QuizGuard System

QuizGuard is a C++ console application for creating, managing, and taking quizzes with secure user authentication. It uses SHA-256 hashing for password security, supports quiz optimization via greedy and knapsack algorithms, and employs linked lists, stacks, and queues for data management. Features include customizable themes, result tracking, and time-based quiz constraints.

# Algorithms

# SHA-256-based Complex Hashing:

Purpose: Secures user passwords, dates of birth, and institution names by generating a custom hash.
Implementation: The complex_hash function in AccountHash.cpp uses SHA-256 with salt and pepper for added security, incorporating right rotation, padding, and a custom character set for output.
Usage: Applied during signup, sign-in, password recovery, and account updates.


# Greedy Algorithm:

Purpose: Prioritizes quiz questions based on marks (value) over time when users choose to maximize marks.
Implementation: The greedyQuizGuard function in AccountHash.cpp sorts questions by marks in descending order and selects all, ignoring time constraints.
Usage: Used in the quiz-taking process when option 1 (Prioritize Marks) is selected.


# 0/1 Knapsack (Dynamic Programming):

Purpose: Optimizes quiz question selection to maximize marks within a time limit.
Implementation: The knapsack function in AccountHash.cpp uses a dynamic programming table to select questions based on time (weight) and marks (value), with backtracking to identify selected questions.
Usage: Applied in the quiz-taking process when option 2 (Prioritize Time) is selected.


# Bubble Sort:

Purpose: Reorders quiz questions based on their assigned keys during the quiz-taking process.
Implementation: In giveQuiz, a bubble sort variant swaps adjacent question nodes (including question text, answers, and marks) to reorder them.
Usage: Ensures questions are presented in the desired order after knapsack or greedy selection.



# Data Structure Concepts

# Singly Linked List:

Purpose: Manages user accounts and quiz lists.
Structures:
Node in AccountHash.cpp: Stores user details (username, hashed password, salt, pepper, etc.) and a pointer to a quiz list.
Quiz in AccountHash.cpp: Stores quiz details (name, questions, time, marks) with a pointer to the next quiz.
AllQuiz in AccountHash.cpp: Maintains a global list of all quizzes with creator usernames.


Usage: Used for account management (insertNode, delnode, searchuser) and quiz storage (createQuiz, displayUserQuizzes).


# Doubly Linked List:

Purpose: Stores quiz questions for easy navigation (forward and backward) during quiz-taking.
Structure: Questions in AccountHash.cpp contains question text, answer, marks, and pointers (next, prev).
Usage: Managed via enqueue for question creation and navigated in giveQuiz for answering questions.


# Stack:

Purpose: Tracks the current question during quiz-taking to allow revisiting.
Structure: stack in AccountHash.cpp stores question text with a next pointer.
Usage: Implemented in push, pop, and peek to manage question display and navigation (prev, next) in giveQuiz.


# Queue:

Purpose: Organizes questions during quiz creation.
Structure: Questions in AccountHash.cpp is used as a queue during enqueue.
Usage: Questions are added to the queue in createQuiz to store them sequentially.


# Vector:

Purpose: Stores question weights (time) and values (marks) for algorithmic processing.
Structures: weights and values in Quiz for knapsack and greedy algorithms; selectedQuestions and selectedQuestionss for tracking chosen questions.
Usage: Used in giveQuiz to pass data to knapsack and greedyQuizGuard.

# How to Use

Main Files

QuizGuard.cpp is the main file that drives the program. AccountHash.cpp is a supplementary file for managing user account creation. It does not function independently.

Audio Files

.wav files are included for sound effects and are compatible with Dev-C++. Compatibility with other IDEs, such as Visual Studio, is not guaranteed.

Setup Instructions

Download QuizGuard.cpp, AccountHash.cpp, and the .wav files to your system. Ensure the .wav files are placed in a directory of your choice and update the file paths in the code. For example: PlaySound(TEXT("C:/Users/PC/Downloads/User.wav"), NULL, SND_FILENAME | SND_SYNC); Replace the file path with the location of the .wav file on your system. Placing them in the Downloads folder will minimize changes.

Configuring Sound in Dev-C++

To enable sound functionality in Dev-C++, follow these steps: Go to Tools > Compiler Options. Add -lwinmm to the linker commands.
